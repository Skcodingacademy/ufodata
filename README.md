Welcome to the UFO Sighting Prediction project! This project is a fascinating exploration into UFO sighting data, encompassing various stages from data cleaning to predictive modeling. Below is an overview of the project:

Project Overview:
Data Cleaning: Cleaning of the UFO sighting dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Data Manipulation: Skillful manipulation of the dataset to extract insights and create new features.
Feature Engineering: Crafting innovative features to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
Predictive Modeling: Development of a robust predictive model capable of forecasting the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of future UFO sightings.
Visualization: Mapping the model's predictions onto the outline of the United States map for intuitive interpretation and analysis.
